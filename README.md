# Machine-Learning-Projects
Projects done through Udacity's Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree. Projects cover CNN's, RNN's and GAN's.


Projects Include:

1) Predicting Bike Rentals: A basic layered network that uses python's basic functionality (rather than TensorFlow). This was
   my first neural network and a great way to understand the math behind neural networks before utilizing more convenient 
   deep-learning packages.

2) Classify Images: Use TensorFlow to create a convolutional neural network that can classify images into one of ten categories

3) Language Translation: Use TensorFlow to create a recurrent neural network that can translate simple phrases from English
   to French.

4) Generate TV Scripts: Utilize TensorFlow and scripts from the Simpson's to create a recurrent neural network that can
   generate new scripts for scenes in Mo's Tavern.

5) Generate Human Faces: utilizes a generative adversarial network to generate unique human faces.
